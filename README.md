# Personal Website

Every term, I've redone my personal website after learning new skills. This is the latest iteration, done mostly with React.js.

All graphics are done by myself in Adobe Illustrator.

I'm also using React Router for routing purposes (clearly), and Styled Components.

My lecture notes are written in Markdown and LaTeX, and rendered with React-Rich-Markdown (Temporarily until I make my own).

To-do:
* Projects page
