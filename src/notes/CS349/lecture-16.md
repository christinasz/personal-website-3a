## Input Devices

The iPod Wheel was a great thing for its time, but now that music libraries can be huge, it is no longer a great input device since the list you navigate through is super long.

### Dimensions to Classify Computer Input

* Sensing
  * mechanical (switch)
  * motion (gyroscope, accelerometer)
  * contact (pressure)
  * signal processing (audio)
* Continuous vs Discrete
* Degrees of Freedom

### Specific vs General Input Devices

Some devices you never really see because it makes more sense to carry around a small number of general purpose input devices than several very specific ones. E.g. do you bring a second keyboard with your laptop on a day to day basis?

### Keyboard

QWERTY was designed to slow typing down to reduce jams.

#### Perceived QWERTY problems

* Common combinations require awkward finger motions (e.g. tr)
* Common combinations need you to jump off the home row (e.g. br)
* Common combinations are typed with one hand (e.g. were)
* Most of the typing is done with the left hand
* 16% of typing requires the lower row, 52% top row, 32% home row

#### DVORAK

* Optimized layout for two handed keyboard
* Big challenge: it's hard to unlearn QWERTY and learn a new keyboard
* Nobody uses DVORAK, so nobody knows how to use it
* No evidence that it helps anybody

**Optimizations from Dvorak**

* Letters are typed by alternating between hands
* 70% of keyboard stroke are on the home row

### Mechanical Design of Keyboards

One trend that hurt everybody was the ship towards notebooks - they are constantly downsized to fit by using either smaller keys or removing some keys (e.g. number pad). This is a much more significant problem than DVORAK vs QWERTY keyboards

### Virtual Keyboards

* Flat/touchscreen keyboard
* Advantages:
  * Portable
  * No extra hardware
  * Customizable layout
    * Example: Macbook Pro Touch Bar 
* Disadvantages:
  * Small keys
  * No tactile or mechanical feedback
  * Resting of hands is uncomfortable

### Chording Keyboards

Like piano chords! Holding multiple together at the same time means something

Modern version: Twiddler - made for wearable computing input

### Text Recognition and Gestures

* Graffiti/Unistroke gestures
  * Maps single strokes to "enter letter" commands 
* Natural Handwriting recognition
  * dictionary-based classification algorithms
