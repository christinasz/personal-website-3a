# CS349 - User Interfaces
September 10, 2018

### The History of Interaction
* The earliest computers were human computers up until the 1940s

#### Batch Interface (1945-1965)
* Input: Punch card, output: paper response
* Only operated by experts

#### Conversational Interface (1965 - 1985)
* Still no GUI
* Menu driven - user gives a command and waits for a response
* Basically the terminal
* Still used by experts

##### Command Line Interface
Advantages
* Highly flexible and efficient

Disadvantages
* Users need to know the computer and the language
* Requires **recall** not **recognition**

#### Recognizing User Needs
People started to recognize that there was a high barrier to entry to using computers, and some visionaries started to imagine a different form of interaciton

**Vannevar Bush**
* Goal was to augment human intellect
* Published an article called "As We May Think" that inspires computer scientists to this day
* Imagined something called the Memex - dual display, personalized interaction, indexing content, hyperlinking
* NEURAL INTERFACE

**Ivan Sutherland**
* Sketchpad
  * Light pen
  * Early GUI
* Wanted to expand access to computers to artists, draftsmen
* Built something similar to CAD

**Douglas Engelbart** (RIP)
* Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
* Invented mouse, hypertext and **COPY PASTE**
* Father of UX

**Alan Kay**
* PhD student of Ivan Sutherland
* Pioneered OOP, Xerox Star, Dynabook
* "The best way to predict the future is to invent it" WOW WHAT A COOL QUOTE
* HE FUCKING HARDCODED THE DYNABOOK IT'S MADE OUT OF WOOD

#### Graphical User Interfaces (~1981)
##### Xerox Star
* First commercial GUI - had windows, icons, folders, and mouse
##### Apple Macintosh
* Brings GUI to the masses and shifted the entire industry
* Following this, Microsoft Windows, Commodore Amiga, IBM OS/2 all started to come out

**Characteristics of a GUI**
* Hardware interface
  * Display
  * Keyboard
  * Pointing device
* Software interface
  * Shows graphical input and output

**Advantages of GUI**
1. **User remains in control** at all times - system *waits* for input and then responds
2. Emphasizes **recognition** of interface features over **recall** of commands - enables discovery
  * You can hand it to almost anyone and they can figure out how to use basic functions
3. Uses **metaphor** to make the interface more familiar (e.g. desktop, folder, etc.)

#### Modern and Future Interaction
Where can we go from here?
* Gesture interfaces - e.g. Kinect, MYO armband
* Touch interfaces - e.g. iPhone, smartwatch, haptic interfaces
* Voice interfaces - e.g. Alexa, Google Home
* Augmented Reality
* Virtual Reality
