# Lecture 20 - Direct Manipulation

One of the interaction tree type questions from the midterm will probably end up on the final!

**Direct** - virtual representation of an object is manipulated back in a similar way to a real-world object

* Lets you feel that they are directly controlling the objects represented by the controller - Apple
  * Which is why Apple's 'natural' scrolling is reversed from Windows because Windows believes you're moving the viewport, Apple feels like you're manipulating the document itself

Example: indirect is if you were to have a terminal command that scrolls text in a window, direct is where you click and scroll

## Direct Manipulation Principles

It should feel like you're working with a "real object". From Schneiderman's (the guy who gave this a name) research: 

1. Continuous representation of task objects and actions
2. Task objects are manipulated by physical actions, not complete syntax
3. Fast, incremental and reversible actions with effects on task objects immediately apparent
4. Layered, self-revelaing aproach to learning

### Benefits of Direct Manipulation

Makes users feel like they're interacting with the domain so they focus on the task and not the technology
