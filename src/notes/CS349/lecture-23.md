## Mobile UI

Phones are intended for you to be able to be walk around with, portable, (hence mobile) It was designed for use in different ways than your laptop was

You're not really using a keyboard, but rather touch

Why touch?

* Space optimization (think old BlackBerries)
  * Combine input and output
  * Allows interfaces to be customized

Touch is not perfect

* Some things that would be better as physical interfaces are now touchscreens
  * e.g. volume knobs vs. touchscreen

* Precision

Tradeoff is not just the smaller screen - you can't just take your desktop app and shrink it to your smaller screen, and the fact that you don't have as precise of an input device (your finger is not as precise as your cursor)

**Device Characteristics**

Limited resources:

* Limited memory
* Processing
* Battery conservation
  * Need optimization techniques that take the power consumption down

Primarily touch interaction

* Input capabilities and challenges

Mobile form factor

* Small display size
* Different aspect ratios/orientations
* Single application focus

All about tradeoffs - willing to accept slower processory, less memory -> longer battery life

#### Capacitive Touch Screen Technology

*Don't worry about memorizing this for an exam*

* Surface Capacitance
  * Voltage applied to conductive material creates an electorstatic field
    * Why touch screen doesn't work with gloves on
  * Apple Pencil is not capacitive

##### Capacitive Touch Screens

* Projective Capacitive
  * X-Y grid of thin wires that build a grid and there's a capacitor at each wire intersection
  * Measures effective capacitance at each point

### Touch Sensing Accuracy

Touch screen input is very noisy, especially estimates pressure

### Display Size

Display size has pretty much capped out at around 5" to 6" because your hand can't reach that far
